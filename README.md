# teaching-made-easy

# OBJECTIVE
To solve the problems faced by teachers as well as students during online education/classes.

# INTRODUCTION
Pandemic has affected almost every person irrespective of their occupation. Even though the medium of education has shifted from Offline to Online, and work from home is encouraged for everyone, yet during these tough times, teachers’ lives have become tougher. As many of our teachers have children, who too have online classes from home, it becomes really hard for our teachers to manage their time in evaluating assignments and tests. In addition, keeping an eye on every student is also a challenge during online classes. From students’ point of view, students of the primary school also struggle as many of them don’t have knowledge of operating computers, and parents have to sit with them throughout the class to assist them in doing so. Keeping in mind that many parents are working, online classes fail to be interactive, comfortable, and productive for many students.

# PROPOSED SOLUTION :
In order to solve the above problems, we have come up with our project: Teaching Made Easy - Your assistant in Online Education. We have created an Assignment Checker using NLP. The checker will take the questions and their model answers/ ideal answers as input from the teacher. The students will submit their answers through a form, from which data will be fetched and fed into our Deep Learning Model of NLP following which the grade will be displayed on our web-page interface for the teacher as well as student. The web page interface allows options to create assignments, as well as show students’ performance and class performance. For keeping an eye on every student during the online sessions hosted on any platform, we have created a python program using OpenCV library, which will take the video feed of live class as input and give tags to everything it identifies as human. The tags will be - attentive, not attentive, confused, and speaking. Keeping in mind the struggles faced by students in primary schools, like in muting or unmuting themselves during online classes. Also, many students get unnoticed during classes as they don’t know about the feature of raising their hands and many don’t know how to raise their hands virtually. We have created another deep learning model, which will also take the live feed of online class as input. It will try to identify hand gestures of students, and will classify them as “raising hand”, “mute” and “unmute”.

# TECH STACK
* HTML5
* CSS
* Bootstrap
* JavaScript
* Jquery
* Flask
* Deep Learning
* NLP (Natural Language Processing)

# NOVELTY
* Unlike present similarity checkers, our project is based on semantic similarities using deep neural networks which is much more efficient and provide accurate results.
* Also, we provide feedback to students, in the form of pointers on where their answer was lacking.
* We solve a very crucial problem faced by teachers, that they can’t monitor all the students altogether.
* Also a very efficient solution to solve the lack of ability of the students of the primary section to use the online class' platform.

# FUTURE IMPLEMENTATION
Using our computer vision model,we will create a database of child's behaviour.
We will perform anomaly detection using database ondaily basis and inform parents regarding any suddenchanges in child's behvaiour.
This will help parents to know better regarding what factor resultin sudden changes in their child's behvaiour like sudden grief, orscolding them, arguments between parents etc.
A child's personality and nature is decided in such early stages of life, and also our model canshow child being disturbed by whats going onaround like someone troubling them or bullying them. So we aim to create a better life duringearly childhood and also better mental health ofsmall children, as directly or indirectly many of them go through a lot, especially during the pandemic.
      Our program, shall be a great way to keep a check on a child's mental health. In today's world, when anxiety and depression is effecting people of all ages, one age group that is not discussed upon that much is children of primary and junior classes. Therefore, our program shall effect the entire education in a good way as it has the added benefits of being easy to access and usefuk to students and teachers. It is then when our aim to bring about a good change in the society shall be achieved.
